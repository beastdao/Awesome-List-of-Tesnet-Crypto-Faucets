# Awesome List of Tesnet Crypto Faucets
A list of popular, working and free Testnet Faucets (all **easy**, **fast** and **safe** to use, **without ads**) to get Testnet ETH and Tokens in 2025 

# What is a testnet (Sepolia, Holesky, Mumbai etc)?
Short for "test network" a network used to simulate the behavior of the main network (for example **Ethereum**, **Base**, **Polygon** etc).

# What is faucet?
Faucet is service that dispenses funds in the form of free test tokens like ether (for example **Sepolia** ETH, **Holesky** ETH etc) that can be used on a testnet.

A testnet faucet provides web3 developers with free tokens for deploying, testing, and optimizing smart contracts on test **blockchains** such as **Sepolia**, **Holesky**, **Mumbai** etc.

Because smart contracts on public, **mainnet** blockchains like **Ethereum**, **Polygon**, **Base** etc require gas fees to deploy and interact with smart contracts, testnets provide blockchain developers with a network that mirrors production blockchain environments without requiring using real native currency like ETH for gas fees that cost real money.
